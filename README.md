This badly written nonsense is my attempt at a controller to replace the one I found lurking in a Eberspacher D5S with a canbus interface for the Renault Master. It will eventuall provide a basic control protocol to allow it to be messed with over serial, N2K and probably just a simple on/off control input so you can use these units on boats etc without needing an entire Renault Master van in tow.

There is a PCB in Eagle too, kinda.

Please bear in mind it will probably set on fire, burn down your house, cause your cat to imnplode etc.
